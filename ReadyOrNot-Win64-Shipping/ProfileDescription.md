## Installation and configuration
Inject and play.
### Mods
Install the [Removes Black Layer Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/readyornot/mods/4229)
Also recommended: [M320 Sights flipped up for better aiming](https://www.nexusmods.com/readyornot/mods/3605)
### In Game settings
- Go to settings and disable ADS ZOOM, or else your weapons will be warping when using ads button(left trigger)
- Abnormal screen ratios can also cause issues, Im using 16:9
- To ensure less glitches at every start of round you should open up tablet once and cylce throgh all guns including the ballistic shield or grenade launcher
- General info concerning body parts not invisbile: USE STANDARD SKIN ONLY, dont wear any extras:
"LSPD long sleeve shirt", "LSPD Tactical Pants", Assault gloves, no styles
## Holsters
- You can use grip to trigger actions from shoulders, hips, chest l/R, Helmet, center lower back
## Troubleshoot
- Body parts visible: Make sure to wear the default clothing as described on Nexus
- Black window: Black layers mod not installed.
- Stretching weapons: Ingame: FOV settings (90 FOV and 16:9 aspect ratio works for me) and disable ADS ZOOMING
- Controls are weird when playing in Multiplayer: go to uevr menu (with l3+r3) and enable "multiplayer support" in Input menu
- Only one eye renders: Dont use SteamVR with Virtual Desktop
## Alternative Gamepad Config
- Crouch(right stick down), Walk when left trigger, Left Ear LTrigger is VOIP
- Download my input ini from [optional files](https://www.nexusmods.com/readyornot/mods/3612?tab=files) and put the ini into AppData\Local\ReadyOrNot\Saved\Config\Windows
